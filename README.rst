iutils
------

iutils is a collection of Python utility codes, encompassing various topics, that I have written, regularly use and update for my own research work. 


Topics
''''''

* **Optics** (`iutils.optics`) - Fourier optics, geometric optics, beam optics, colormaps designed for rendering PSFs

* **Signal processing** (`iutils.signal`) - Function for several basic signals and transforms

* **Computer vision** (`iutils.cv`) - Various geometric transformations such as affine transformation, homography computation, etc.

* **Computer graphics** (`iutils.cg`) - Rigid body transformations using Euler angles

* **Image processing** (`iutils.image`) - Various image processing utilities, especially image I/O related 

* **Maths** (`iutils.math`) - Various math utility codes, for array processing, geometry, etc.

* **Plotting** (`iutils.plot`) - Utilities for plotting using Mayavi and Matplotlib, colormaps viewer, domain mapping, viewing complex functions, image comparator, etc.

* **Miscellaneous utilities** (`iutils.pyutils`) - Utility functions written in Python; E.g., comparing floats, finding `Nones` in Lists, display utilities, simple tkinter message box, `nbconvert` in directory etc.

The code is not meant to be production quality. However, the work, and I strive to write as well as I can. Please feel free to use it if you find any of them useful for your own work.
Both performance and general accuracy of the code is not guaranteed.
