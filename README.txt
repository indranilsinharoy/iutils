iutils
======

iutils is a collection of Python utility programs that I use and update in my 
own research work in various topics. 


Topics
------

* Optics - Fourier optics, geometric optics, beam optics, colormaps designed for rendering PSFs

* Maths - various math utility codes, for array processing, geometry

* Signal processing - function for several basic signals, transforms

* Image processing - image I/O utilities 

* Computer vision - computing homography, 

* Plotting - utilities for plotting using Mayavi and Matplotlib, colormaps viewer, domain mapping, viewing complex functions, image comparator, etc.

* General Python utilities - e.g. comparing floats, finding Nones in Lists, etc.




Please note that the code here is not meant to be release quality, but they 
are workable, and I strive to write as well as I can. I also revisit  
the code from time to time to improve the quality.
Please feel free to use it if you find any of them useful for your own work.
Both performance and general accuracy of the code is not guaranteed. 

Most of the code here is written by me, but wherever I have
borrowed ideas, I have cited the source appropriately.
