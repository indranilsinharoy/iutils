Collection of my Python utility programs that I use in my own research work.

The code here is not meant to be release quality, but they are workable, and I strive to write
as well as I can. I also try to revisit the code from time to time to improve the quality.

All programs, if not exclusively stated in the individual file, are licensed under MIT license.

Please feel free to use it if you find any of them useful for your own work.

Both performance and general accuracy of the code is not guaranteed. 

Indranil Sinharoy.
